/**
 * The `ctx.compaction` / `ctx.tokenMeter` seam surfaces, as the compact()
 * binding consumes them — STRUCTURAL MIRRORS (the same standing rule as
 * `subagents-surface.ts`): `@deepseek-ai/dsh-compaction` is deliberately NOT
 * a dependency of this package. The host-plane engine (typically
 * `dsh-compaction-basic`, a deployment choice the DASHR preset documents as
 * host-owned) is read with the untyped `ctx.get('compaction')` escape hatch,
 * and only the operations the binding actually calls are typed here.
 *
 * The DASHR-scoped engine (design A, `compactModel` set) is the one place a
 * real upstream class is used: `BasicCompactionEngine` is dynamically
 * imported from the OPTIONAL peer `@deepseek-ai/dsh-compaction-basic` and
 * constructed under `ctx.isolate('compaction')`, so it never collides with a
 * root-provided engine (cordis keys service registration by isolation label)
 * and never leaks outward. The import being dynamic is what keeps the
 * dependency optional: a deployment that never sets `compactModel` never
 * loads the package.
