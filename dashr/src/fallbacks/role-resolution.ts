/**
 * Dispatch-time three-stage role resolution (plan fallbacks-role-automatch
 * Task 2).
 *
 * Precedence (first hit wins):
 * 1. explicit — `session.header.agentPreset` trimmed matches a declared role
 *    id → that role's DECLARED RAW id (via the `roleIds` trimmed-id map, the
 *    same canonicalization the rules path uses); the reserved `'inherit'`
 *    and undeclared presets are NEVER dispatchable explicit roles and fall
 *    through to rules;
 * 2. rules — the existing `resolveRole` passthrough, unchanged (a declared
 *    role wins; no-rule-match / an explicit rule targeting `'inherit'`
 *    resolve to `'inherit'`);
 * 3. auto-match — only when stage 2 resolved to `'inherit'` AND
 *    `opts.automatchEnabled`: call `opts.automatch` with the agent. The hook
 *    (Task 3 supplies the bounded LLM caller) MUST return a declared raw id
 *    or `null`; the resolver defensively validates the return against
 *    `roleIds` — an unknown id warns and resolves to `'inherit'`, never an
 *    undeclared role. When `automatch` is undefined or `automatchEnabled`
 *    is false the hook is skipped.
 *
 * `'inherit'` is the single "no specific role" outcome — reached by
 * no-rule-match OR an explicit rule targeting `'inherit'` — and both are
 * auto-match eligible when enabled. An operator who wants a class to never
 * auto-match sets `roleAutoMatch: false` (→ `automatchEnabled: false`).
 *
 * Pure ordering logic: no config object and no LLM service inside this
 * module — the LLM is an injectable hook owned by Task 3/4.
