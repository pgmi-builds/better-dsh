/**
 * T1 (plan llm-fallbacks-settings-gateway) + T3 (plan fallbacks-role-seeds) —
 * host-side `fallbacks` config gateway: the `/api/fallbacks/get` +
 * `/api/fallbacks/set` + `/api/fallbacks/reset` + `/api/fallbacks/revert-seed`
 * endpoints.
 *
 * Transport: the typertGateway `/api` interceptor is the single host-wide RPC
 * slot (a plugin must NOT `connection.rpc.intercept('/api')` again — it would
 * throw). The service declares a typertGateway binding (via the
 * `TypertRemoteService` base — kept ONLY for its `typertRemote` binding, which
 * dispatch's `validateBinding` requires on the live service) and the
 * endpoints are registered EXPLICITLY through
 * `ctx.typert.register(fallbacksTypertContribution())` (see `apply` in
 * `src/index.ts`) — NOT via `@Remote` SRC markers: SRC discovery reads
 * `remoteMethods()`, a module-private WeakMap in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-typert-protocol`,
 * so a locally-linked plugin whose peers resolve outside the host
 * installation never shares that table with the host typertGateway (zero
 * claimed endpoints, `/api/fallbacks/*` 404). The explicit
 * `TypertRegistry.register` path writes the invocation descriptors into
 * `ctx.typert.local`, which `claimsEndpoint` checks FIRST, so claim +
 * dispatch work regardless of module identity. The payload contract is
 * exactly one plain-object `args` field whose keys are the method parameter
 * names (`get()` → `{ args: {} }`; `set(patch)` → `{ args: { patch } }`;
 * `reset()` → `{ args: {} }`).
 *
 * Data: `get` reads the `FallbacksSettingsBridge` source — the same live
 * composed config the runtime reads (schema defaults → plugin-row base →
 * settings user layer). There is NO hard-gate resolver (unlike advisor's
 * `resolveAdvisorConfig`): the fallbacks decision path runs at
 * `agent/request` time in `src/index.ts`, so the gateway returns the raw
 * composed config — `enabled` is a plain config field, not a gate output.
 * `set` validates the patch against the `Config` schema first (unknown-key
 * rejection unchanged — the settings service itself is non-strict and would
 * merge the unknown key through), then writes the USER layer in-process via
 * `ctx.settings.update` (no exposed-namespace gate on the in-process write —
 * the wire-level `exposedNamespaces()` check only guards the apiproxy path),
 * and returns the new composed value. `reset` (fallbacks-specific third
 * method — advisor has only get/set) clears the user layer via
 * `ctx.settings.replace(ns, {})`: `set` is merge-only and cannot express
 * "reset to composition defaults" (sending default VALUES as a patch would
 * pin stale defaults into the user layer). Every read response (get/set/reset)
 * carries the additive `seeds: SeedsWireStatus[]` badge state (spec §9.4) and
 * `revert-seed` exposes revert-to-current-seed-default for one id — both
 * delegate to the per-apply `FallbacksSeedManager` passed into the
 * constructor (single point of truth, no copied manager logic).
 *
 * The settings service is OPTIONAL (no settings service → the bridge source
 * stays the entry, `get` still works; `set`/`reset` fail with a clear
 * error — KD-G5 fallback). The gateway captures the service through a
 * conditional `ctx.inject(['settings'], ...)` child (the same activation
 * pattern as `installSettingsSection`), because `ctx.settings` is only
 * resolvable from a fiber that declares it.
 *
 * The returned config is normalized to the typertGateway JSON wire boundary:
 * only schema-declared keys cross the wire, and absent values are OMITTED,
 * never present-as-undefined (the gateway's result validation rejects
 * undefined values).

/**
 * The explicit typert contribution for the `fallbacks` gateway endpoints —
 * registered via `ctx.typert.register(...)` (see `apply` in `src/index.ts`).
 * The descriptors mirror exactly what the former SRC discovery derived from
 * the `@Remote` markers (`src:<ns>#<endpoint>` identity shape, direct
 * receiver, JSON wire params with `src-json` codec), so the host
 * typertGateway claim + dispatch behavior is the same — the only difference
 * is the registration does not depend on the module-private `remoteMethods`
 * marker table, which a locally-linked plugin can never share with the host
 * installation (see the module docblock).
