    # kernel boots, idles between cells, or unwinds a finished one — escapes
    # the shell's containment and terminates the process cleanly, which used
    # to kill the kernel deterministically (10/10 same-tick aborts, 40/40
    # during cold boot; dev/m2a-report.md §5.1). The handler therefore only
    # raises while a dashr cell is actually executing, tracked by the
    # module-level _dashr_state dict below and set/cleared by the run/snapshot
    # cell scaffolds around their whole body. A stray SIGALRM outside that
    # window is swallowed — the host's force-settle already resolves the run,
