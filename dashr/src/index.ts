/** `dashr-repl`: the DASHR RLM mode — one plugin, one row.
 *
 * Naming (v0.1.5 layer model): the runtime class is `DashrRuntime`, the
 * standing-mount-layer component — one instance per mount holding the
 * cross-session kernel map, hence the de facto daemon while the
 * profile-level `DashrDaemon` concept stays an empty shell; the session
 * layer is each ipykernel subprocess, a pure interpreter with no harness
 * awareness.
 *
 * This package merges what were two sibling plugins into a single
 * composition row: `DashrRuntime` (the stateful kernel runtime — the
 * `ctx.replRuntime` implementation, mounted first, below) and the
 * agent-plane presentation
 * (blueprint §7.4) — the `eval` transport tool, the generated Tool
 * Catalog prompt section, the model-direct-call collapse, the tool→binding
 * bridge that binds the registry's agent-visible tools as `await tool.name(args)`
 * members (v0.1.5 Q8: one `tool` holder, no flat globals), the displaced
 * `send_message` bridge (ADR-0001: the single dual-direction A2A channel),
 * the Continual Harness (`refine`), and the compaction surface (`compact`).
 *
 * The presentation row registers against the harness tool registry the way
 * any dsh tool row must (shape-mirroring `dsh-agent-tool-presentation` and
 * the code-mode half of `dsh-tools`, 0.1.0-rc.6), but it re-points execution
 * at our own `ctx.replRuntime` (the harness's runtime seam, vendored from
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-code-runtime` in `src/vendored/rlm-runtime.ts` as an
 * interface only): the host registry stays untouched, and this row composes
 * per scope — a DASHR preset mounts it in its standing scope, so every agent
 * joined under that preset gets the cell surface while PTC / native presets
 * in the SAME process keep their own presentation. One row per composition,
 * not one per session. The seam is transport only: the KERNEL semantics —
 * resident IPython REPL, context as variables, last-expression completion —
 * are ours, not the upstream code mode's.
 *
 * Registration deltas from the upstream code-mode row, recorded per
 * blueprint §7.6:
 * - `eval` (not `run_code`): the registry reserves `run_code`
 *   unconditionally, and a distinct name is what lets a DASHR preset and a
 *   PTC code preset share one process registry without collision.
 * - The transport is an ORDINARY scoped registration, not the registry's
 *   reserved non-filterable transport: reservation is registry-private
 *   machinery a plugin cannot mint. Under our own scope the effect matches
 *   (visible only to this composition); a nested scope could restrict it
 *   away, which upstream forbids — accepted for M2 Stage A.
 * - The model-direct collapse is a `ctx.tools.guard()` denial (after the
 *   pre-execute waterfall) rather than the registry's pre-pipeline
 *   `UNKNOWN_TOOL`: same model-facing route-back text, different pipeline
 *   stage. `tools.guard` is the published monotonic-denial extension point.
 * - The `system-prompt/assemble` listener that filters `assembly.tools` down
 *   to `eval` uses the assembly waterfall's documented authority
 *   (dsh-tools README: "its returned assembly is authoritative").
 *
 * The runtime is mounted at the TOP of `apply` (before the presentation
 * injects), so a DASHR preset against a runtime-less composition fails AT
 * MOUNT — named in the preset's activation audit — instead of at the first
 * prompt. The presentation resolves `ctx.replRuntime` at USE time (never a
 * static inject): a static inject entry would hold the whole composition
 * hostage to the runtime service existing, and the `eval` execution
 * path re-reads `ctx.get('replRuntime')` with an actionable error,
 * mirroring upstream `requireCodeRuntime`.
 * @module dashr-repl
