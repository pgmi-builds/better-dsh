/**
 * The `ctx.subagents` seam surface, as this presentation plugin consumes it —
 * a STRUCTURAL mirror of the host-plane `@deepseek-ai/dsh-subagent` Service
 * Definition (0.1.0-rc.6), which is deliberately NOT in this package's
 * dependency graph: subagents is a host-plane root-realm singleton (the
 * preset delegates its registration to the host composition), and importing
 * the package here would pull a host-plane capability into an agent-plane
 * plugin for typing alone. The send_message(receiver='parent') uplink reads
 * it with the untyped `ctx.get('subagents')` escape hatch (the same
 * optional-capability pattern upstream's child-agent.ts uses for
 * `agentPresets`/`sandboxPolicy`), and this file only types the one
 * operation the bridge actually calls.
 *
 * Host-plane note (v0.1.8): the row mounts on the HOST plane (the bundle
 * patch's `insert`), so `ctx.replRuntime` is a process-global service and
 * `ctx.subagents` — a host-plane root-realm singleton — is reachable from
 * the presentation layer without any preset realm. The uplink callback
 * therefore lives in THIS presentation layer: it is the one place that can
 * simultaneously reach `ctx.subagents` (outward), the reporting child
 * `Agent` (`exec.agent`), and the run's abort signal.
 *
 * Downlink note (ADR-0001): spawn/fork/send_message/list_agents/interrupt
 * bridging goes through the TOOL layer, not this surface — the delegation
 * tools carry the deployment's enforcement surface (approval, sandbox,
 * maxDepth, config) that a direct service call would bypass. This mirror
 * exists only for the ONE direction no tool covers: a continuable child
 * reporting up to its parent.
