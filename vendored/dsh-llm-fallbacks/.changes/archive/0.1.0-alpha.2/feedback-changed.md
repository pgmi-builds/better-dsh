- In-conversation fallback switch notice now reads 模型已降级 / Model downgraded with a warn-tone title (was neutral 模型切换 / Model switch).
- Declared roles must configure a model chain: the settings card blocks saving a chain-less role (inline hint + banner), and host config validation warns on a missing/empty role chain (never crashes; runtime fallback to `rootChain` preserved).
