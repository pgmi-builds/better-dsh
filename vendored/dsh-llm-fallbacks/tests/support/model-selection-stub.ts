/**
 * In-test semantic double for `installModelSelection`
 * (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent/model-selection`). Mirrors the REAL host
 * listener's `agent/request` contract (packages/core/agent/src/model-selection.ts):
 * `await next()`, then apply the assembled selection on top of the resolved
 * config, dropping any inherited `reasoningEffort` (the
 * `withoutInheritedEffort` pattern). It is the host-NATIVE double — the
 * fallback-routing marker check that used to live here (spec §2.5 D-1,
 * local dsh-agent patch) is gone with the patch removal (plan
 * llm-fallbacks-runtime-depatch, T2).
 *
 * The real one registers on an agent-scoped context; the double registers on
 * the shared test context — waterfall registration order is exactly what the
 * composition tests assert (cordis: first-registered listener = outer =
 * final say after `next()`), so the shared context is the right seam.
 *
 * @module tests/support/model-selection-stub
