/**
 * Vocabulary types for the code-execution seam: what a caller hands a
 * {@link ./repl-runtime.ts | ReplRuntime} and what it gets back. Pure types — no
 * runtime code lives here.
 *
 * Vendored from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-code-runtime@0.1.0-rc.6` (`src/types.ts`)
 * per blueprint v0.5 §7.6: type shapes are the interop contract our
 * presentation/SDK work builds against, so they are carried unchanged apart
 * from the recorded deltas:
 *
 * 1. the module header and the two `../index.ts` doc links were rewritten for
 *    this location;
 * 2. `CodeRunRequest.principal` is a DASHR-OWNED field (M3-A, blueprint §6
 *    "kernel per-session 键控"): upstream's seam deliberately has no session
 *    concept, but a stateful backend must key its persistent substrate by the
 *    calling session or every session sharing one service instance would
 *    share one namespace. Optional so upstream-shaped requests stay valid —
 *    an absent principal addresses the provider's shared default key.
 * 3. `CodeBindingNamespace.callable` is a DASHR-OWNED field (M3-B, blueprint
 *    §9, introduced for the rlm() bare-callable binding family — deleted in
 *    v0.1.8, kept for shape compatibility): upstream's object-holder model
 *    (a global whose MEMBERS are callable) cannot express a bare callable
 *    global. `callable: true` declares the global itself is a
 *    function; `functions` then carries exactly one entry — the single host
 *    function the global call dispatches. Optional so upstream-shaped
 *    namespaces stay valid.
